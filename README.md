# Sigma Mongoose Intro
An overview for today's Mongoose lecture.

We are starting with an application that will run and serve our
index page with `npm start`. Some of the client-side markup is completed.

We will complete this application using Angular and Mongoose.

## Agenda

1. Connect to Mongo using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), a node module.
2. Define a Mongoose Schema for our Documents.
3. Create base GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE server-side routes.
4. Implement the Mongoose syntax needed to support the above routes.
5. Use Angular to add, display, update and delete people.
6. Explore a pre-save hook provided by Mongoose.

## New Terms
